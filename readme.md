# Gmork

This is a package I initially setup for the name. The Gmork is a fictional character from The Neverending Story books and movies.
The Gmork is depicted as a huge black wolf with glowing green eyes. It helps "The Nothing" in destroying our dream world.

### Wat?
This is a way for me to play around with making cli tools. I needed a safe place to just throw code around with out caring.
As this grows it may become something more and stabalize, but for now it is just hacking quick and fast.

### Goals

- [x] setup env to build and bundle a cli tool
- [ ] carve out a way to make the architecture plugin based
- [x] stay focused

# Gmork
This is a package I initially setup for the name. The Gmork is a fictional character from The Neverending Story books and movies.
The Gmork is depicted as a huge black wolf with glowing green eyes. It helps "The Nothing" in destroying our dream world.

### Wat?
This is a way for me to play around with making CLI tools. I needed a safe place to just throw code around with out caring.
As this grows it may become something more, but for now it is just hacking quick and fast.

### Goals

- [x] stay focused
- [x] setup env to build and bundle a CLI tool
- [x] carve out a way to make the architecture plugin based
- [ ] smoothly run other CLI tools
- [x] catch those errors gracefully
- [x] link to the docs or issues on failures/errors


### Plugin Architecture

Ideally I want a easily plug n play solution for adding new features.
Something that will either wrap a function and then call it internally, or/and
some way to map over a directory and instantiate all the files within by name
